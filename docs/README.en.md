## FAQ

### How to preset the image proxy and API instance if you build it yourself?

Refer to [#10](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/discussions/10) and [#13](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/discussions/13) to set up the environment variable. You can create a new `.env` file in the project root directory and fill in the environment variables in the following format:

```env
TEST="lalala"
ABC=DEF
```

### Some artworks cannot be viewed using US/UK IP

See pixiv official announcement: https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=10837

It is recommended to log in to this site with your own account before using it, and select a non-US/UK region in the official web page [settings](https://www.pixiv.net/setting_user.php). It is best to select the Japan region.

### Keep prompting that the API exceeds the limit or Rate Limit

You can switch the API instance in the settings, or directly use RefreshToken or OAuth to log in.

### How to get RefreshToken

See https://www.nanoka.top/posts/e78ef86/

### Image loading is very slow

Due to the network environment, the image loading speed may be slow. You can switch to the image proxy in the settings, or download the Android version and turn on the image direct connection function.

### Cookie/SessionID login error

It is recommended to use RefreshToken to log in

### Is there an iOS App?

Currently there are only Android and Windows versions. Download: [Releases](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/releases)

### Android version crashes after clicking download

Go to the system settings to give this application storage permissions, or download the latest version and try again.
